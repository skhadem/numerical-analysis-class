        "It's often quite handy. For example, if you have the same matrix $A$ but many different right-hand-sides $b$, then you only need to find the LU decomposition of $A$ once (this is the expensive, $O(n^3)$ part), and then for each right-hand-side, just do backsubstitution (relatively cheap, at $O(n^2)$).\n",

See more at the [Matlab systems-of-equations](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/math/systems-of-linear-equations.html) documentation which also shows you how to use the new [`decomposition`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/decomposition.html) function ).  You can either ask for a LU factorization explicitly and save it, or as for a vague \"decomposition\" and Matlab will guess a factorization (LU, Cholesky, etc) and then save it, and then you can use this with the backslash `\\` seemlessly.  Neat!\n",

        "*To be more accurate, the true equivalent of `scipy.linalg.solve` is Matlab's [`linsolve`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/linsolve.html).  It's like backslash but it doesn't guess the structure of the matrix for you, rather you have to tell it. So that can be more annoying, but it can also save computational time (if you know it's a symmetric matrix, no need for Matlab to numerically check if it is, etc.)\n",
