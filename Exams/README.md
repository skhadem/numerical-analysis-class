## Study aids
The best way to study is doing practice problems.  Below are links to similar classes that have problems sets and/or exams (sometimes with solutions, sometimes without):


- CU's APPM 4650 from Fall 2013, taught by Chris Ketelsen. Homeworks (no solutions) are available below:
  - [HW 1](https://www.colorado.edu/amath/sites/default/files/attached-files/hmwk1_0.pdf) on floating point numbers, stability of the quadratic equation, the bisection method, and convergence.
  - [HW 2](https://www.colorado.edu/amath/sites/default/files/attached-files/hmwk2_0.pdf) on fixed-point iterations and Newton's method
  - [HW 3](https://www.colorado.edu/amath/sites/default/files/attached-files/hmwk3_0.pdf) on interpolation
  - [HW 4](https://www.colorado.edu/amath/sites/default/files/attached-files/hmwk4_0.pdf) on interpolation and splines
  - [HW 5](https://www.colorado.edu/amath/sites/default/files/attached-files/hmwk5_0.pdf) on finite differences and Richardson extrapolation
  - [HW 6](https://www.colorado.edu/amath/sites/default/files/attached-files/hmwk6_0.pdf) on quadrature (and composite quadrature) and Romberg integration
  - [HW 7](https://www.colorado.edu/amath/sites/default/files/attached-files/hmwk7_0.pdf) on linear algebra
  - [HW 8](https://www.colorado.edu/amath/sites/default/files/attached-files/hmwk8_0.pdf) on iterative methods for linear algebra

- MIT's  "Introduction to Numerical Analysis" (18.330) on OCW, taught by Laurent Demanet in 2012, which has a  [list of HWs](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-330-introduction-to-numerical-analysis-spring-2012/assignments/) (no solutions)

- MIT's ["Introduction to Numerical Methods"](https://github.com/mitmath/18335) (18.335) on github, taught by Steven Johnson in 2020. Older years are listed as different branches (it goes back to 2008, skipping a few years). Much of the class is a different focus (more on linear algebra, FFT, etc) but there is overlap, and there are problem sets with solutions. (Also, the class is taught in Julia)
  - [HW 1](https://github.com/mitmath/18335/blob/master/psets/pset1.pdf) on floating point, and Newton methods
  - [HW 2](https://github.com/mitmath/18335/blob/master/psets/pset2.pdf) on stability (ignore part about norms, SVD and least-squares)
  - After that the HWs are less relevant to our class, though you may be interested in [Lectures 11 and 12](https://github.com/mitmath/18335#lecture-11-feb-26) on caching in algorithms; our class doesn't focus as much on implementation of algorithms so we won't cover this in much depth.
