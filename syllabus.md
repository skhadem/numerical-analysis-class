# Syllabus for APPM/MATH 4650 Intermediate Numerical Analysis

Fall 2020, Instructor: Stephen Becker (Applied Math dept)
This semester, the course is remote-only due to COVID-19

### Official course description
Focuses on numerical solution of nonlinear equations, interpolation, methods in numerical integration, numerical solution of linear systems, and matrix eigenvalue problems. Stresses significant computer applications and software. Department enforced prerequisite: knowledge of a programming language.

Requires a **prerequisite** course of MATH 3430 or APPM 2360 (these are ODE or ODE + linear algebra courses) and APPM 3310 (matrix methods), all with a minimum grade of C-.  We'll use a lot of math from your previous courses, especially:
- lots of calculus, including: Taylor's theorem, fundamental theorem of calculus, IVT, EVT, MVT, sequences and series, limits, continuity, Riemann sums, L'Hopital's rule
- Facts about polynomial roots (fundamental theorem of algebra); complex numbers
- Vector spaces, subspaces, bases
- Solving ODEs; ODE theory
- Solving linear equations, vector operations (dot products), matrix multiplication

### Related courses at CU
This course is similar to the CS department's [CSCI-3656 Numerical Computation](https://github.com/cu-numcomp/numcomp-class/) but has a bit more analysis (and more math prerequisites), fewer implementation details, and similar but not identical topics.

This APPM/MATH 4650 course is cross-listed in both the Applied Math and Math departments. It is offered every semester, being taught in the fall by an Applied Math instructor (usually 2 sections) and in the spring by a Math instructor (usually 1 section), and sometimes it is offered in the summer as well.  The second semester course is 4660, taught in spring by Applied Math; about half the students in 4650 take the second semester course.

### Programming
Homeworks will involve by mathematical analysis and programming.

Students are expected to already know how to program.  We encourage using Python and Matlab; Julia is another good choice though we will not be using it explicitly.  For homework assignments, usually the deliverable is the outcome of some code, so therefore the student may choose any reasonable programming language. However, we will be doing demonstrations in Python and/or Matlab (and the instructor/TA are best at debugging Python and Matlab).  Most of our demonstrations will be using [github](http://github.com) in conjunction with [python via colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

### Principal Topics
- Floating point numbers
- Roots of 1D nonlinear equations
- Interpolation, polynomial approximation, splines
- Numerical differentiation and numerical integration (quadrature)
- Numerical methods for solving initial-value problems in ordinary differential equations
- Gaussian elimination, LU, and solving linear systems

### Learning Goals/Outcomes
[//]: # ( Not testable; high-level )

- Be able to pick an appropriate computing environment and when to use existing libraries/frameworks
- Be able to translate numerical algorithms into fast, easy to read and generalizable pieces of software
- Know which mathematical problems are efficiently solvable on a computer

# Subjects on the midterms and final

You might try the [midterm study guide jupyter notebook](https://github.com/cu-numcomp/numcomp-class/blob/master/Midterm-StudyGuide.ipynb) used for the CS department's version of this class.

Both midterm exams were take-home exams, self-timed with generous time limits. They had true-false/multiple-choice component via Canvas (closed note, closed book) for 45 min, and then 2 hours to solve word problems (scanned, uploaded to Gradescope) which was open note and open book but closed internet.  The exams are posted at [Exams](./Exams); solutions are available on Canvas.

  - 5.6 *multistep methods
  - 5.7 variable step-size Multistep methods (covered only very briefly)
  - 5.8 extrapolation methods (covered only very briefly)
  - 5.9 *higher-order equations and systems of ODEs
  - 5.10 *stability (zero-stability/root-condition)
  - 5.11 *stiff ODEs (absolute stability)
- Chapter 6 (solving linear systems of equations)
  - 6.1 *linear systems of equations
  - 6.2 pivoting strategies
  - 6.3 *linear algebra and matrix inversion (this should be review, but is's very important, so it has an asterisk)
  - 6.4 determinant of a matrix (we didn't do a lecture on this but it's review from your linear algebra class, so you should make sure you're familiar with it)
  - 6.5 *matrix factorization (LU factorization)
  - 6.6 special types of matrices (LDL, Cholesky, tridiagonal systems)
  - You should know the complexity of matrix multiplication
  - You should have an understanding of LAPACK and BLAS
  - The condition number of a matrix and its relevance
  - We are *not* testing on least-squares methods

Details on the final exam: unlike the midterms, this is not take-home.  We'll have a true-false/multiple-choice section on Canvas, then a written section that you'll scan and upload to Gradescope. There are 2.5 hours for the exam. We'll do this via zoom and you need your webcam on. We'll also use Proctorio, so make sure you have Chrome installed as well as the Proctorio Chrome extension.  This is an open-note exam and you can use your notes, my notes, and the book, but no internet is allowed (other than Canvas/Gradescope).
